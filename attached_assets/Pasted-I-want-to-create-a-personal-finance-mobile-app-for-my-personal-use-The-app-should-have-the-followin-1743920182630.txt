I want to create a personal finance mobile app for my personal use. The app should have the following core functionalities, with all data stored locally on my device: 1. **Data Input:** * Allow me to input financial transactions from various sources, including: * Uploading PDF files (specifically credit card bills). The app should be able to parse the transaction details (date, description, amount, any available tags/labels). * Importing CSV files (e.g., bank account statements). The app should guide me through mapping the columns to relevant fields (date, description, amount, category/label if present). * Manual entry of individual transactions with fields for date, description, amount, and a user-assignable category/tag. 2. **Automated Categorization:** * When PDF or CSV bills are uploaded, the app should automatically attempt to categorize transactions based on keywords or labels present in the description or any dedicated category/tag column. * Allow me to define and customize categorization rules (e.g., "Restaurant ABC" always goes under "Dining"). * For manual entries, provide a user-friendly way to select a category from a predefined list or create new categories. 3. **Consolidated Updates:** * Treat each imported bill (PDF or CSV) as a single update event, consolidating all the transactions within it. 4. **Credit Card Payment Reminders:** * For each credit card bill I input, prompt me to set a payment due date. * The app should send me local reminders (notifications) a few days before the due date. Allow me to customize the timing of these reminders. 5. **Spending Analytics:** * Generate visualizations and summaries of my spending habits, such as: * Spending by category over different time periods (e.g., monthly, yearly). * Trends in spending over time. * Breakdown of spending by payment method (if this information can be extracted). * Allow me to filter analytics by date ranges and categories. 6. **Data Export:** * **Provide an option to export all the locally stored transaction data as a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file.** The exported CSV should include fields for date, description, amount, and category. 7. **Local Data Storage:** * All transaction data, categorization rules, user settings, and reminder schedules must be stored securely on my device. Do not use any cloud-based storage or require an internet connection for core functionality. * Consider using a local database solution like SQLite for structured data. **Please generate the necessary code structure, UI elements, and logic for this app, keeping in mind the requirement for local data storage and all the functionalities described above, including the data export feature.** **Optional Considerations (you can address these if relevant and feasible):** * Suggest libraries or frameworks that would be suitable for this type of mobile app development (e.g., React Native, Flutter, native Android/iOS). * Provide guidance on how to handle different PDF and CSV formats. * Outline a basic user interface flow for each of the core functionalities, including the data export process. Thank you!
